# Camel in action (2nd edition) by Claus Isen and Jonathan Anstey
The project is the result of my practice during I read this book. I start to read the book now (December 28th, 2023). I hope that after reading this book:
- I could implement EIP easily in my future solution,
- I could engineer a corporate IT System and have in mind all its challenge,
- I could understand the limit of integration system based on messaging
